         Hi, Iâ€™m P.L.N Kashyap from Visakhapatnam. I have an engineering background in Information Technology and graduated in 2012. During my third year of college, I faced a major setback due to a severe accident that resulted in multiple surgeries and left me bedridden for several months. The physical and mental challenges from that ordeal significantly impacted my career trajectory. However, I stayed resilient, motivated myself, and overcame the odds by focusing on my recovery and future goals.

My journey into web development began with a fascination for building applications, leading me to master the MERN stack. I created my first project, The Great Indian Dessert, a web application for ordering delicious desserts and having them delivered straight to your doorstep.

Following that, I developed an Expense Tracker application, enabling users to monitor their monthly expenses, categorize them, and visualize spending trends through interactive charts.

I have 1.1 years of professional experience as a Frontend Developer at Cynapto Technologies in Mumbai, from May 2023 to the end of May 2024, where I honed my skills in React.js and JavaScript.
